However, you can use a domain search engine like Domainr (https://domainr.com/) or Instant Domain Search (https://instantdomainsearch.com/) to search for available domain names across multiple registrars and marketplaces.

Once you find a domain you like, you can then research the websites that offer it for sale and compare prices and features to find the best deal. This can be time-consuming, but it's worth it to ensure you get the right domain for your needs at a reasonable price.
