Vikara can be especially helpful to people who may at times find themselves overeating, occasionally binge eating, and who may have body image issues. But in general Vikara can benefit anyone interested in adopting long-term healthy eating habits.

Automation is not just my passion but an obsession. We only have scratched the surface. So much more to automate and endless possibilities.  6+ patents and innovation, much more to go.   My ideal / nirvana of automation: 1. Connect brain and google search (without computer / phone) so knowledge is not just in your fingertips but right in your train of thoughts - neuro mirroring? 2. Power conversations through API 3. Personal upvotes - true upvotes to motivate kind acts, favors / deeds, leadership, professional help, a true social help platform through automation across all social channels 4. Space travel simplified and cheap 5. Time travel and teleportation (joke?)
